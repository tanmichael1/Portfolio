I created a website using JavaScript, CSS and HTML as practice for myself while taking Angela Yu's Web Development online course. 
I decided to have this be an alternative movie review website, and it's a way for me to practice my coding skills. 
I am continuisly improving this site, and expanding certain elements. 

The site is very much a work in progress and won't replace the Wordpress site where I actually have my reviews, but it's nonetheless something that I created and a way 
that I'm challenging my skills and using it to improve myself as a coder.
