          <p>
            I am a recent graduate, having completed my Computer Science and
            Computer Graphics degree at Victoria University. I currently work as a Software Developer at Datacom.

          <p>
            I have always been interested in computers and digital technology,
            and my academic strengths in school included Math and Physics. I
            would like to create software for people to use and to be helpful in
            their lives. I am passionate about learning, creating, and using new
            technologies.

            If I’m not coding or working, I’m
            watching movies or writing movie and tv reviews and screenplays.
