            I am a recent graduate, having completed my Computer Science and
            Computer Graphics degree at Victoria University.

            I have always been interested in computers and digital technology,
            and my academic strengths in school included Math and Physics. I
            would like to create software for people to use and to be helpful in
            their lives. I am passionate about learning, creating, and using new
            technologies.

            If I’m not coding or working on my own web development projects, I’m
            watching movies or writing movie and tv reviews and screenplays.
